My personal website!

To Do list:

- Collapsable nav on mobile
- Change top icons when hovered (v2), possibly make synth a gif with animated screen and upsiz it to 72px
- Background images of lakeshore area, make them scaled properly on mobile
- Landing page animation, swirling water gear only visible on computer
- Contact form complete, learn PHP to send it to my email
